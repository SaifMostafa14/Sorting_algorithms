# Sorting_algorithms
Implementing sorting algorithms and testing their runtimes on arrays of sizes 10, 100, 1000, and 10000. Analyzing and comparing their runtimes to determine which are more effecient when working with small and large data. 

Algorithms implemented are: 
1- Exchange Sort 
2- Insert Sort 
3- Binary Insertion Sort
4- Selection Sort
5- Merge Sort 
6- Heap Sort
7- Quick Sort
8- Radix Sort
